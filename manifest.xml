     Using a subsumtion architecture, the robot will scan a room
     using a laser scanner and search for a safe new home noted by
     concrete pillars and a single door. The robot must avoid obstacles,
     have a special door behavior, have a dance that it performs when the
     safe room is detected, and a wander behavior to move around in the
     room.
